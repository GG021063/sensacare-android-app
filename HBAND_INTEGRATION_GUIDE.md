# HBand SDK Integration Guide

## 🎯 What's Ready

I've created a **Web Bluetooth API wrapper** for the HBand Android BLE SDK that converts it to work in your PWA environment.

## 📁 Files Created

```
src/lib/devices/hband-sdk/
├── README.md           ← Integration guide
├── types.ts            ← HBand-specific type definitions
├── web-adapter.ts      ← Web Bluetooth API implementation
└── index.ts            ← Main exports
```

## 🔧 How to Use

### **Step 1: Test the Integration**
The HBand SDK is already integrated into your device framework. You can test it by:

1. **Go to Settings → Device Test**
2. **Click "Scan for Devices"**
3. **Look for HBand devices** in the list

### **Step 2: Add Your SDK Files**
If you have the actual HBand SDK files (.aar, .jar, etc.), you can:

1. **Create a folder**: `src/lib/devices/hband-sdk/android/`
2. **Copy your SDK files** there
3. **Update the web-adapter.ts** to use your specific protocol

### **Step 3: Update Protocol Implementation**
The current implementation uses **mock service UUIDs**. You'll need to:

1. **Replace the UUIDs** in `types.ts` with your actual HBand service UUIDs
2. **Update the data parsing** in `web-adapter.ts` to match your device's protocol
3. **Test with real HBand devices**

## 🚀 Current Status

- ✅ **Web Bluetooth API wrapper** created
- ✅ **Type definitions** for HBand devices
- ✅ **Integration** with existing device framework
- 🔄 **Protocol implementation** needs your actual SDK details

## 📋 Next Steps

**Tell me:**
1. **Do you have the actual HBand SDK files?**
2. **What are the service UUIDs** for your devices?
3. **What's the data format** your devices use?

**Then I'll:**
1. Update the protocol implementation
2. Test with real devices
3. Deploy the integration

## 🧪 Test Now

You can test the current implementation:

1. **Visit**: `https://mobile.sensacare.health`
2. **Go to Settings → Device Test**
3. **Try scanning** for HBand devices
4. **Check browser console** for any errors

The framework is ready - we just need your specific device protocol details! 🎯
