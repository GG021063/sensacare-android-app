# Device SDK Integration Guide

## üéØ Current Status
- ‚úÖ PWA deployed and working
- ‚úÖ Supabase database configured
- ‚úÖ Mock device SDK framework ready
- üîÑ **NEXT: Integrate your real device SDK**

## üì± Supported Device SDKs

### 1. **Fitbit SDK**
```bash
npm install @fitbit/sdk
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
VITE_FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=your_fitbit_client_id
VITE_FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_fitbit_client_secret
VITE_FITBIT_REDIRECT_URI=https://mobile.sensacare.health/auth/fitbit/callback
```

### 2. **Garmin Connect SDK**
```bash
npm install @garmin/connect-sdk
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
VITE_GARMIN_CONSUMER_KEY=your_garmin_consumer_key
VITE_GARMIN_CONSUMER_SECRET=your_garmin_consumer_secret
```

### 3. **Apple HealthKit** (iOS only)
```bash
npm install react-native-health
```

### 4. **Google Fit API**
```bash
npm install googleapis
```

**Environment Variables:**
```env
VITE_GOOGLE_FIT_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
VITE_GOOGLE_FIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
```

### 5. **Custom Device SDK**
If you have a custom wearable device SDK, we can integrate it directly.

## üîß Integration Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Device SDK
Tell me which device SDK you want to integrate, and I'll:
1. Install the required packages
2. Create the adapter implementation
3. Configure environment variables
4. Update the device connection logic

### Step 2: Test Device Connection
Once integrated, we'll test:
- Device discovery
- Authentication flow
- Data synchronization
- Real-time data streaming

### Step 3: Production Deployment
- Add environment variables to Vercel
- Test on production domain
- Verify PWA + device integration

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option A: Fitbit Integration (Recommended)
- Most popular wearable platform
- Well-documented API
- Good PWA support

### Option B: Garmin Integration
- Premium fitness devices
- Advanced metrics
- Good for athletes

### Option C: Apple HealthKit
- iOS ecosystem integration
- Comprehensive health data
- Requires iOS device for testing

### Option D: Custom Device
- Your specific wearable device
- Direct SDK integration
- Full control over data

## üìã What I Need From You

**Please tell me:**
1. **Which device SDK** you want to integrate?
2. **Do you have API keys/credentials** for the chosen platform?
3. **What specific health metrics** do you want to capture?
4. **Any special requirements** for your device?

## üîç Current Mock Implementation

Right now, the app uses a mock FitTrack SDK that simulates:
- Device discovery
- Heart rate data
- Step counting
- Sleep analysis
- Battery level monitoring

This allows you to test the UI and data flow while we integrate your real device SDK.

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Choose your device SDK** from the options above
2. **Get API credentials** from the device platform
3. **I'll implement the integration** and update the code
4. **Test the full flow** from device connection to data sync
