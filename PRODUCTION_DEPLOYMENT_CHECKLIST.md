# Production Deployment Checklist for Sensacare PWA

## üîß Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables
Create a `.env.production` file with:

```bash
# Disable mock mode for production
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false

# Supabase Configuration (replace with actual values)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-production-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-production-anon-key

# PWA Configuration
VITE_APP_NAME=Sensacare
VITE_APP_DESCRIPTION=Health tracking app for wearable devices

# Feature Flags
VITE_ENABLE_BLUETOOTH=true
VITE_ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS=true
VITE_ENABLE_OFFLINE_SYNC=true
```

## üì± PWA Configuration Verification

### ‚úÖ Manifest.json
- [ ] `display` is set to `"standalone"`
- [ ] `start_url` is set to `"/"`
- [ ] Icons are properly configured (144x144, 192x192, 512x512)
- [ ] Theme colors match your brand

### ‚úÖ index.html
- [ ] PWA meta tags are present
- [ ] Apple-specific meta tags for iOS compatibility
- [ ] Manifest link is correct
- [ ] Favicon is set

## üîå Bluetooth Connectivity

### ‚úÖ HBand SDK Integration
- [ ] `HBandSimpleAdapter` is properly configured
- [ ] Web Bluetooth API permissions are handled
- [ ] Device authentication flow is implemented
- [ ] Error handling for connection failures

### ‚úÖ Permission Management
- [ ] Bluetooth permission request UI
- [ ] Location permission (required for Android)
- [ ] Notification permission
- [ ] Graceful fallbacks for denied permissions

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Create production environment file
cp .env.example .env.production
# Edit .env.production with actual production values
```

### 2. Build and Deploy
```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel --prod
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] App loads correctly at production URL
- [ ] Bluetooth permissions work on mobile devices
- [ ] Device connection flow functions properly
- [ ] Mock mode is disabled
- [ ] Supabase connection is working

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Mobile Device Testing
- [ ] Test on Android Chrome
- [ ] Test on iOS Safari
- [ ] Verify PWA installation works
- [ ] Test Bluetooth device discovery
- [ ] Test device connection flow
- [ ] Verify permission requests work

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (desktop and mobile)
- [ ] Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Firefox (desktop)
- [ ] Edge (desktop)

## üîç Critical Issues to Address

### 1. HBand Protocol Implementation
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs real device testing
- Current implementation uses `acceptAllDevices: true`
- Need to test with actual HBand devices
- May need to implement specific service UUIDs

### 2. Service Worker
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing
- No offline capability
- No background sync
- Consider adding minimal service worker

### 3. Error Handling
**Status**: ‚úÖ Good
- Comprehensive error handling in place
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful degradation to mock mode

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Bundle Size
- [ ] Main bundle is under 500KB (currently ~883KB)
- [ ] Consider code splitting for better performance
- [ ] Optimize images and assets

### Loading Performance
- [ ] First Contentful Paint < 2s
- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint < 4s
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1

## üîí Security Considerations

### HTTPS
- [ ] Production site uses HTTPS
- [ ] All API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] Web Bluetooth requires secure context

### Data Privacy
- [ ] User consent for data collection
- [ ] Proper data handling practices
- [ ] GDPR compliance if applicable

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Error Tracking
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Monitor Bluetooth connection failures
- [ ] Track user engagement metrics

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Track PWA installation rates
- [ ] Monitor device connection success rates

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan
- [ ] Keep previous deployment as backup
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Test rollback process

### Support Contacts
- [ ] Document who to contact for issues
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts
- [ ] Prepare user support documentation
